## Scenario
=========== <br>
You have been assigned to develop a conference management system for a prestigious event management company. <br>
The goal of the project is to create a robust platform that will streamline the organization and scheduling <br>
of conferences, manage speakers, and facilitate efficient scheduling for attendees.<br>

### Key Features:

1. Conference Creation: The system allows event managers to create new conferences by providing details such as
   the conference name, category, date, venue, and theme.

3. Speaker Management: The system provides a comprehensive database to manage speakers. Event organizers can add,
   edit, and remove speaker profiles, including their name, bio, contact information, profile picture, and areas of expertise.

4. Schedule Management: The system enables event managers to create schedules for conferences. They can define time
   slots, assign speakers to specific sessions, and set the duration of each session.

5. Attendee Registration: The system includes a registration portal where attendees can sign up for the conference.
   Attendees can provide their personal information, select sessions they wish to attend, and make payments if required.

6. Session Reminders: The system sends automated session reminders to registered attendees, ensuring they are notified
   about upcoming sessions and any changes in the schedule.

7. Reporting and Analytics: The system generates reports on various aspects of the conference, such as attendance statistics,
   session popularity, and speaker ratings. These insights help event managers make informed decisions for future conferences.
